        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 25, 2023</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>AppZen Studio</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with the <strong>PDF Toolkit</strong> mobile application (the "App").</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Core Privacy Promise:</strong> PDF Toolkit is designed as a local-first utility. We believe your private documents should stay private. Therefore, we do not employ cloud-based processing for your files. All document manipulations are performed locally on your device hardware.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>A. Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not require users to register an account, provide a name, email address, or phone number to use the App. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) through the core functions of the App.</p>
        
        <h3>B. Non-Personal & Technical Data</h3>
        <p>To improve App performance and stability, we may collect non-identifying technical information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and model.</li>
            <li>Operating system version.</li>
            <li>App version and build number.</li>
            <li>Crash logs and performance metrics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Processing and Storage</h2>
        <p>All data processing, including but not limited to PDF compression, merging, splitting, OCR, and document scanning, occurs <strong>locally on the user's mobile device</strong>. We do not have access to, nor do we store, the contents of the files you process using PDF Toolkit. Once a file is processed, it is saved to your device's local storage according to your preferences.</p>

        <h2>3. Permissions and Their Necessity</h2>
        <p>The App requests the following permissions for specific functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To enable the Document Scanner feature. Frames are analyzed in real-time and converted to PDF/Image locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Read/Write):</strong> To import PDF documents from your device and to save the processed results back to your library.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required for advertisement delivery and checking for App updates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">AdMob</a> (For advertisement delivery)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AdMob uses unique identifiers from your device to show you relevant ads. You can opt-out of personalized advertising in your Android device settings.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect your documents or personal data, we do not retain such data. Temporary files created during the PDF optimization process are stored in a temporary cache directory and can be cleared by the user at any time through the App settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in using our App. However, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Because your data stays on your device, we recommend using built-in OS security features like biometrics and encryption to protect your device storage.</p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at the developer email provided in the Google Play Store listing.</p>
