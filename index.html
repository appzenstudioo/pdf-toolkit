        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: October 2023</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>PDF Toolkit</strong>. Your privacy is our highest priority. Unlike many other PDF applications, PDF Toolkit is built with a <span class="highlight">"Privacy-First"</span> philosophy.</p>

        <h2>1. Zero-Cloud Data Policy</h2>
        <p>We believe your documents belong to you. PDF Toolkit operates as a <strong>fully local utility</strong>. All file processing, including compression, merging, splitting, and scanning, is performed strictly on your device's local processor. Your files are never uploaded, transmitted, or stored on any external servers controlled by us.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers. The app does not require account creation to function.</p>

        <h2>3. Use of Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used exclusively for the document scanning feature. Images are processed in real-time and saved only to your local storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage/Media Access:</strong> Necessary to read the PDF files you select and to save the output files to your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Used only for displaying advertisements and providing AI-assisted features (if used).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services (Advertisements)</h2>
        <p>To keep our professional features free, we use Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain data, such as your device's advertising ID, to improve ad relevance. You can manage these preferences in your Android device settings. Please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since your data stays on your device, the security of your documents depends on your device's security. We recommend using device encryption and secure lock screens to protect your files.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding this policy, please reach out via the developer contact information provided on the Play Store.</p>
